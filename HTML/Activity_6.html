					<br><li><i><u><b> <font face="monotype corsiva" color="purple" size="4">Volleyball</font></b></u></i> , game played by two teams, usually of six players on a side, in which the players use their hands to bat a ball back and forth over a high net, trying to make the ball touch the court within the opponents’ playing area before it can be returned.
					To prevent this a player on the opposing team bats the ball up and toward a teammate before it touches the court surface—that teammate may then volley it back across the net or bat it to a third teammate who volleys it across the net.
					A team is allowed only three touches of the ball before it must be returned over the net.</br>
					<br><li>Volleyball was invented in 1895 by <i><u><b> <font face="monotype corsiva" color="purple" size="4">William G. Morgan</font></b></u></i>, physical director of the <i><u><b>Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) in Holyoke, Massachusetts.</b></u></i>
					It was designed as an indoor sport for businessmen who found the new game of <i>basketball<i> too vigorous. Morgan called the sport “mintonette,” until a professor from Springfield College in Massachusetts noted the volleying nature of play and proposed the name of <i>volleyball</i>. 
					The original rules were written by Morgan and printed in the first edition of the <i><u><b>Official Handbook of the Athletic League of the Young Men’s Christian Associations of North America (1897).</b></u></i> The game soon proved to have wide appeal for both sexes in schools, playgrounds, the armed forces, and other organizations in the United States, and it was subsequently introduced to other countries.

				<br><li><i><u><b> <font face="monotype corsiva" color="green" size="4">Basketball</font></b></u></i> , game played between two teams of five players each on a rectangular court, usually indoors. Each team tries to score by tossing the ball through the opponent’s goal, an elevated horizontal hoop and net called a basket.</br>
				<br><li>The only major sport strictly of U.S. origin, basketball was invented by <i><u><b> <font face="monotype corsiva" color="green" size="4">James Naismith (1861–1939) </font></b></u></i> on or about December 1, 1891, at the <i><u><b>International Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) </b></u></i>Training School now Springfield College, Springfield, Massachusetts, where Naismith was an instructor in physical education.</br>
				<br><li>In the early years the number of players on a team varied according to the number in the class and the size of the playing area. In <u><b><i>1894</i></b></u> teams began to play with five on a side when the playing area was less than <i><u><b>1,800 square feet 167.2 square metres</b></u></i> the number rose to seven when the gymnasium measured from <i><u><b>1,800 to 3,600 square feet 334.5 square metres</b></u></i> and up to nine when the playing area exceeded that. In 1895 the number was occasionally set at five by mutual consent; the rules stipulated five players two years later, and this number has remained ever since.</br>

				<br><li><i><u><b> <font face="monotype corsiva" color="darkblue" size="4">Chess</font></b></u></i> one of the oldest and most popular board games, played by two opponents on a checkered board with specially designed pieces of contrasting colours, commonly white and black. White moves first, after which the players alternate turns in accordance with fixed rules, each player attempting to force the opponent’s principal piece, the King, into checkmate—a position where it is unable to avoid capture.</br>
				<br><li>Chess first appeared in India about the 6th century AD and by the 10th century had spread from Asia to the <u><b><i>Middle East and Europe.</i></b></u>
				Since at least the 15th century, chess has been known as the <u><b><i>royal game</i></b></u> because of its popularity among the nobility. Rules and set design slowly evolved until both reached today’s standard in the early 19th century.
				Once an intellectual diversion favoured by the upper classes, chess went through an explosive growth in interest during the 20th century as professional and state-sponsored players competed for an officially recognized world championship title and increasingly lucrative tournament prizes. Organized chess tournaments, postal correspondence games, and Internet chess now attract men, women, and children around the world.</br>
				<br><li>Chess is played on a board of<u><b><i> 64 squares arranged in eight vertical rows</i></b></u> called files and eight horizontal rows called ranks. These squares alternate between two colours: one light, such as white, beige, or yellow; and the other dark, such as black or green. The board is set between the two opponents so that each player has a light-coloured square at the right-hand corner.</br>
				<br><li>chess originated around <i><u><b> <font face="monotype corsiva" color="darkblue" size="4">200 B.C. Hán Xin, a commander,</font></b></u></i> invented chess to represent an important battle in the history of China.

				<ol type="I">
				<br><li><i><u><b> <font face="monotype corsiva" color="darkViolet" size="4">Badminton</font></b></u></i> , court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock also known as a <u><b><i>bird or birdie </i></b></u>was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). 
				These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the <u><b><i>Badminton World Federation.</i></b></u> 
				The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. 
				Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by <u><b><i>British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s.</i></b></u> The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.</br>
				<br><li><i><u><b> <font face="monotype corsiva" color="darkViolet" size="4">Badminton</font></b></u></i> first appeared in the <u><b><i>Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972</i></b></u> and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles <u><b><i>one against one</i></b></u> and <u><b><i>doubles two against two.</i></b></u> Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.</br>
				<br><li>The <i><u><b> <font face="monotype corsiva" color="darkViolet" size="4">Duke of Beaufort</font></b></u></i>  is considered the father of badminton. While badminton was not invented by any single person, the <u><b><i>Duke of Beaufort</i></b></u> was pivotal to revolutionizing badminton as the sport we all know and love today.</br>
