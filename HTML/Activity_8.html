					<i><u><b> <font face="monotype corsiva" color="green" size="4">Networking</font></b></u></i>, also known as <u><b><i>Computer Networking</i></b></u>, is the practice of transporting and <sub>exchanging data</sub> between nodes over a shared medium in an information system. 
					Networking comprises not only the design, construction and use of a network, but also the management, maintenance and operation of the <sup>network infrastructure</sup> software and policies.

				<br><dt><h3><em>Router</em></h3></br>
				   <dd> <i><u><b> <font face="monotype corsiva" color="darkblue" size="4"><big>Router</big></font></b></u></i> is a device that connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks. 
				   It serves two primary functions managing traffic between these networks by forwarding data packets to their intended <sup>IP addresses</sup>, and allowing multiple devices to use the same <strike>Internet connection.</strike>
				<br><dt><h4><em>Network switch</em></h4></br>
				    <dd> <i><u><b> <font face="monotype corsiva" color="Yellow" size="4"><big>Network switch</big></font></b></u></i> connects devices within a network often a local area network, or <u><b><i><big>LAN</big></i></b></u> and forwards data packets to and from those devices. 
					Unlike a <sub>router</sub>, a switch only sends data to the single device it is intended for which may be another <u><b><i>switch, a router, or a user's computer, not to networks of multiple devices.</i></b></u>
				<br><dt><h5><em>Network Bridge</em></h5></br>
                     <dd><i><u><b> <font face="monotype corsiva" color="Darkviolet" size="4"><big>Network Bridge</big></font></b></u></i> is a <u><b><i>Computer Networking Device</i></b></u> that creates a single, aggregate network from multiple communication networks or network segments.
					 <u><b><i>This function is called network bridging.</i></b></u> Bridging is distinct from routing. Routing allows multiple networks to communicate independently and yet remain separate, whereas bridging connects two separate networks as if they were a single network.
					 In the <u><b><i>OSI model,</i></b></u> bridging is performed in the data link layer <sup>layer 2</sup>. If one or more segments of the bridged network are wireless, the device is known as a wireless bridge.
				<br><dt><h6><em><big>Wireless Network</big></em></h6></br>
				     <dd><i><u><b> <font face="monotype corsiva" color="Darkviolet" size="4"><big>Wireless networking</big></font></b></u></i> is a method by which homes, <u><b><i>telecommunications networks and business installations</i></b></u> avoid the costly process of introducing cables into a building, or as a connection between various equipment locations.
					 Admin telecommunications networks are generally implemented and administered using radio communication. 
					 This implementation takes place at the physical level <sub>layer</sub> of the <u><b><i>OSI model network struckture</i></b></u>.
